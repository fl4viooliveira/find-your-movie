# Project title: Find your movie!

## Project description

The page will load with a selection of inputs for the user to narrow down the type of movie they would like to watch. The page will then load a selection of movies and their youtube trailers. Past searches will be shown on a section of the screen so that past choices are easily accessible to the user.
